# HI👋, I’m Syed Amiel Mateen!
- 💞️ I've recently worked on my own startup, Job Lobby! (but have mutually decided with my other team members to move on :))
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular and Next.js (and trying to find other JS and CSS libraries and frameworks..)
- 📫 How to reach me: syedamiel3@gmail.com or www.linkedin.com/in/syed-amiel-mateen
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy rock and metal music and also a Man Utd fan (unfortunately..)
